# Hi there, I'm Juan! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I am a physicist with over 30 years of research experience across diverse fields. My work consistently crosses traditional boundaries, integrating statistical mechanics with interdisciplinary fields, particularly artificial intelligence, where I have focused my research for the past decade. Here you'll find a collection of my projects, contributions, and interests.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🌱 I’m currently learning new technologies and improving my skills as data scientist and in machine learning.
- 👨‍💻 I enjoy working on difficult problems and on learning new techniques and ideas.
- 🎓 I have a background in statistical physics (rigurous results, solid-state physics, Monte Carlo simulations, interacting neural networks, genetic programming, ...) with 37 articles published in peer-reviewed journals.
- 🎓 I have taught several math subjects, from Calculus and ODEs to Numerical Analysis, including Statistical Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks at a MSc level, for almost 20 years and to more than 2000 students.
- 💬 I have used Fortran90 (in parallel, with MPI), lisp (CMUCLisp in parallel with a developed-from-scratch PVM platform) and I am currently improving my Python (PyTorch mostly).

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** Fortan90, Common Lisp (CMUCL), Python
